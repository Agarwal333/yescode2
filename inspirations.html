            <h3>Man Plants A Tree Every Day For 40 Years Now Has A Forest Bigger Than Central Park</h3>
            <div class="storyContent">
                <p>What used to be a landscape devastated by erosion is now 1,360 acres of forest and it's all thanks to one Indian man named Jadav Payeng. Jadav planted a tree every single day for 40 years and now this man-made forest is bigger than Central Park. Now this incredible forest is home to hundreds of elephants, rhinos, boars, reptiles, and birds. This botanical-enthusiast says he is planning to plant trees until his "last breath". “Nature is God. It gives me inspiration. It gives me power … As long as it survives, I survive."</p>

            <h3>Mexican Company Creates Single-Use Cutlery Made From Avocado Seeds</h3>
            <div class="storyContent">
                <p>A Mexican company called BioFase created single-use cutlery and straws that biodegrade in just 240 days. Since Mexico is responsible for around 50% of the world’s avocado supply, the country has plenty of avocado seeds that are usually burned in a landfill without any useful purpose. Biofase uses these avocado seeds and gives them a new purpose, reducing the plastic waste in the world.</p>

            <h3>Australian Town Comes Up With A Genius Way Of Stopping Pollution By Simply Using A Net</h3>

                </div>
                <p>In 2018, the city of Kwinana in Australia installed two drainage nets in Henley Reserve. Before these nets were installed, workers would pick up these trash by hand. The total cost of these nets came to be around $20,000 which is way more cost-effective compared to paying for manual labor. This simple invention turned out to be way more useful than anyone expected. In just four months the nets caught around 815lbs (370kg) of trash. If you are inspired to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in our waters, we encourage to learn more about plastic pollution, and how it affects our earth. </p>

            <h3>Volunteers Pick Up 5,3 Million Kilograms Of Trash On A Beach In Mumbai</h3>
            <div class="storyContent">
                <p>To this day this incredible initiative is called “world’s largest beach clean-up project”. Environmentalist Afroz Shaz started picking up the trash from the beach back in 2015, with more and more people joining him, volunteers managed to pick up 5,3 million kilograms of trash. Versova beach in Mumbai was polluted mainly because of the direction of the wind. Since the territory itself was not a popular tourist attraction, there was no action taken to take care of the beach. Now, with the help of 1,000 volunteers, the beach is open for the public to enjoy. </p>
